### ARTIFICIAL LIFESPAN ###

#USE THIS EFFECT IF YOU INTEND TO MAKE A CHARACTER ARTIFICIALLY LONG-LIVED 
#(IN OPPOSITION TO NATURALLY LONG-LIVED, LIKE AN ELF)

#IN "natural_lifespan_X" THE "X" IS THE CHARACTER INTENDED NATURAL LIFESPAN (<5)

#THE NATURAL LONG LIFESPAN SPECTRUM GOES FROM "natural_lifespan_1"/"lifespan_1" to "natural_lifespan_4"/"lifespan_4"
#FROM "lifespan_5" to "lifespan_7", it's all artificial

#effect = {
#	add_trait = lifespan_1
