 bm_alliancewar:0 "Alliance War"
 bm_alliancewar_desc:0 "When Mannimarco, the King of Worms, corrupted the Amulet of Kings just before Emperor Varen's coronation ritual several years ago, he guaranteed that the covenant sealed by Alessia and Akatosh would be broken, and Nirn would no longer be protected from a Daedric invasion. Mannimarco's master, the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, seized the opportunity to initiate the Planemeld, using terrifying Dark Anchors to summon Daedric troops and drag Nirn into the realm of Coldharbour. But three political alliances — the Ebonheart Pact, Daggerfall Covenant, and Aldmeri Dominion — stand against the Daedric Prince and his forces.\n\n#bold The armies of the three alliances converge, ready to fight to the last to preserve their freedom. Never before have the disparate races cooperated so closely, but never before has the threat been so terrible.#!"

 bm_alliancewar_covenant:0 "Daggerfall Covenant" 
 bm_alliancewar_covenant_desc:0 "The Daggerfall Covenant was established in 2E 567 was to end the poverty and suffering throughout the kingdoms of High Rock and Hammerfell caused by dwindling trade routes, which in turn was caused by the many wars happening throughout the land. This could not be done as long as an enemy was sitting on the Ruby Throne. The Merchant King of Wayrest, Emeric, took action and united the previously warring races of Breton, Redguard, and Orc. He earned the trust of the kings of High Rock, earned the alliance with the Redguards by a diplomatic marriage with Maraya of Sentinel, and, finally, made a war treaty with the Orcs. The Redguards, a disciplined and martial people, begrudgingly agreed to join the Orcs thanks to the cunning Bretons, whose political and economic savvy make victory for the Covenant seem possible. Despite internal struggles, the Covenant believes that only it can provide strong leadership and plan for prosperity the Empire needs to survive. Much like the Ebonheart Pact, the Daggerfall Covenant united races that were commonly known as old enemies; the Bretons, Orcs, and Redguards. "
 bm_alliancewar_pact:0 "Ebonheart Pact"
 bm_alliancewar_pact_desc:0 "The Ebonheart Pact is a politically fragile yet powerful military alliance between Skyrim, Morrowind and Black Marsh. It was formed in 2E 572, amidst the turmoil of the Second Akaviri Invasion. Tensions run deep between these unlikely allies, forced to stand together against the threat of Molag Bal and incursions from enemy alliances. The dour, magically-gifted Dunmer of Morrowind have joined the reptilian Argonians—former slaves from mysterious Black Marsh—and boisterous Nords of Skyrim in a bid for sovereignty. Founded in the midst of the Akaviri Invasion of 2E 572, the territory of the Ebonheart Pact stretched over the provinces of Skyrim, Morrowind and Black Marsh at the height of its power. Its capital is the city of Mournhold, located on the mainland of Morrowind, the homeland of the Dunmer, though the faction is led by a Nord nobleman known as Jorunn the Skald-King.[UL 1] One of the most politically unstable but militaristically powerful among the most powerful alliances of Tamrielic history, the three cultures that comprise the Ebonheart Pact shared a great distrust for each other, only holding allegiance to one another because of a common desire to defeat the Empire and preserve their homelands' independence.[UL 1]"
 bm_alliancewar_iliac_emeric:0 "King Emeric"
 bm_alliancewar_iliac_emeric_desc:0 "King Emeric of Cumberland can be rightly described as the pinnacle of Breton achievement. His youth wasn’t misspent idling in a palace and abusing his servants; he learned his father’s trading business, counterbalanced by a regiment of sparring with the Menevia Heavy Dragoons. The canny Emeric used this new wealth wisely, and when the horrific plague of Knahaten Flu slew the entire royal household of the Gardeners, Emeric was the natural choice to assume the throne. The Cumberland dynasty was born. \n\n#bold Can the Trader King of Wayrest keep the Covenant together, Or will the Lions enemies prove too numerious.#"
 bm_alliancewar_summerset_ayrenn:0 "High Queen Ayrenn"
 bm_alliancewar_summerset_ayrenn_desc:0 "Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri was born in 2E 555, on the 5th of Second Seed, which is a very peculiar date that held an abundant amount of significance to the High Elves, causing them to celebrate for fifty-five days, likely playing into her birthdate. Ayrenn was born from King Hidellith and Kinlady Tuinden, who ruled from the city-state of Alinor. She may be a princess by birth, but she is a warrior by heart. It was foretold that her childhood would reflect the restless and chaotic times that she would be born into, and it certainly shows. Ayrenn was a quick-witted and nimble child, having the ability to adapt and overcome anything easily. Her methods would be unorthodox at best. \n\n#bold Can Queen Ayrenn push the Dominion towards her goals or will the ever looming darkness finally take hold?#"
 bm_alliancewar_pact_jorunn:0 "Journn The Skald King"
 bm_alliancewar_pact_jorunn_desc:0 "Born in 2E 546 to Queen Mabjaarn Flame-Hair, Prince Jorunn grew up knowing that his elder sister, Nurnhilde, was fated to take the throne. A singer of rare talent in a culture that reveres the power of the human voice, Jorunn studied at Skald's Retreat on the Isle of Gold outside Riften. There he learned all that could be taught by the most renowned bards of the Eastern Kingdom. He was dubbed the "Skald Prince" of Skyrim. Jorunn spent most of his youth in artistic and philosophical pursuits, cultivating a broad array of artists, artisans, and performers throughout Eastern Skyrim and beyond. He spent time in Mournhold, Stormhold, Sutch, Elinhir, and is even reputed to have visited Solitude, the capital of Western Skyrim, in disguise. Though he claimed to have no interest in politics or the business of rule, his natural leadership qualities made him the unofficial leader of the creative community wherever he found himself. Though he received little formal schooling in the arts of arms and warfare – as little as a prince of the Nords could manage, anyway – traveling across Tamriel was always a dangerous activity. His travels taught him less orthodox ways of dealing with trouble."
